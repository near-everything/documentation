# connect

Your everything account and corresponding NEAR wallet are your keys to interacting with the everything playground.
While all functionalties of the playground require connecting an everything account, only marketplace functionalities require connecting a NEAR wallet.

## everything account

In order to utilize the playground's functionalities like creating a thing or media, you must first connect an everything account.

From the playground's home page, click "connect" under "everything", which will redirect you to an Auth0 login screen. Either login to an existing account or sign up and create a new account.

If the connection is successful, you should see a "you are logged in as {{nickname}}" message and the button changed to "disconnect".

## NEAR wallet

With an everything account connected, you must connect a NEAR wallet in order to utilize functionalities like minting and transacting.

From the playground's home page, click "connect" under "NEAR", which will display a [NEAR wallet selector](https://github.com/near/wallet-selector). Either use the selector to connect your preferred wallet, or create a new wallet through the "NEAR Wallet" option. This will redirect your browser to the NEAR wallet and ask you to create a new wallet.

If the connection is successful, you should see a "you are logged in as {{activeAccountId}}" message and the button changed to "disconnect".
